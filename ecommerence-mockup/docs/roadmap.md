# Helio Ring Ecommerce - Project Roadmap

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Project Status**: ⚠️ CRITICAL - Scope underestimated, timeline extended  
**Original Timeline**: 3 days  
**Revised Timeline**: 5-7 days  
**Completion Risk**: MEDIUM (recoverable with focused execution)

---

## CORE PROBLEM ANALYSIS

### Root Cause Issues
1. **Unrealistic Initial Scope**: 3-day timeline for full ecommerce site was 50% underestimated
2. **React 19 Compatibility**: Shadcn components failing, blocking development
3. **Documentation Drift**: Progress tracking not aligned with actual deliverables
4. **Missing Critical Path**: No clear prioritization of MVP vs nice-to-have features

### Impact Assessment
- **Timeline**: +2-4 days extension required
- **Scope**: Must reduce to MVP for initial delivery
- **Quality**: Risk of rushed implementation if timeline not extended

## RISK MANAGEMENT

### HIGH RISK (Immediate Action Required)
1. **React 19 Compatibility Issues**
   - **Impact**: Blocks Shadcn component usage
   - **Mitigation**: Manual component implementation or React downgrade
   - **Timeline**: +1 day if downgrade required

2. **Animation Performance on Mobile**
   - **Impact**: Poor user experience on mobile devices
   - **Mitigation**: Reduce motion, optimize animations
   - **Timeline**: +0.5 days for optimization

### MEDIUM RISK (Monitor Closely)
1. **Scope Creep**
   - **Impact**: Timeline extension beyond 7 days
   - **Mitigation**: Strict MVP focus, defer enhancements
   - **Timeline**: Contained within current estimate

2. **Performance Targets**
   - **Impact**: Poor Lighthouse scores
   - **Mitigation**: Dedicated optimization phase
   - **Timeline**: Built into Phase 3

### LOW RISK (Acceptable)
1. **Cross-browser Compatibility**
   - **Impact**: Minor issues on specific browsers
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on Chrome/Safari/Firefox
   - **Timeline**: No impact
